# Calculator Layout

## Introduction
The Calculator Layout project is a practice exercise developed using Xcode and UIKit. It focuses on creating a responsive user interface for a calculator app using stack views to ensure proper layout alignment and appearance across different screen sizes and orientations.

## Tech Stack
- Swift programming language
- UIKit framework
- Xcode IDE

## Features
- Responsive layout using stack views to maintain consistency across different screen sizes and orientations.
- Mimics the layout of a standard calculator app with buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and other functions.
- Provides a visual representation of UI design principles in iOS development.

## Process
1. **Layout Design**: Planning and designing the user interface layout using stack views to accommodate various elements.
2. **Stack View Implementation**: Utilizing stack views to organize and manage the placement of UI elements, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
3. **Testing and Refinement**: Testing the layout on device simulators and adjusting constraints and stack view configurations as needed to achieve the desired appearance and behavior.

## Learnings
- **Auto Layout**: Learn how to use Auto Layout constraints effectively to create adaptive user interfaces that adjust to varying screen sizes and orientations.
- **Interface Builder**: Enhance proficiency in using Xcode's Interface Builder to visually design and configure UI elements and constraints.
- **Stack Views**: Develop skills in utilizing stack views to streamline the layout process and simplify the management of complex UI designs.

## Improvement
- Incorporate additional functionalities to make the calculator layout interactive.
- Experiment with different design patterns and styling options.
